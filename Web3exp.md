# Experience at a Web3 Startup (2022–2025)

I spent nearly three years at a Web3-focused company, contributing across multiple functions to help shape the platform’s vision of enabling data ownership, decentralized governance, and innovative blockchain solutions. My work included Quality Assurance (QA), Product Management, DAO Setup, and Strategic Planning, spanning both technical and non-technical responsibilities.

1. Quality Assurance (QA)
Performed manual QA for all product releases, verifying that features met functional requirements and quality standards.

Authored release notes to communicate newly introduced features, bug fixes, and enhancements to internal stakeholders and the wider community.

Collaborated closely with development teams to identify and resolve defects prior to deployment, ensuring a smoother user experience.

2. Product Management
Contributed to product scoping and feature introductions, working with cross-functional teams (design, development, marketing) to refine product concepts and roll out new features.

Assisted in product documentation, providing clear, accessible explanations of the protocol, features, and upgrades.

Helped launch and update core products such as Data NFTs, and Staking, focusing on user experience and ease of adoption.

Participated in protocol research by evaluating potential blockchain integrations and new technologies, collaborating with developers for deeper technical analysis where necessary.

3. Community Engagement
Served as a key contact on Discord, answering questions, gathering user feedback, and sharing updates on product developments.

Provided domain knowledge to the marketing team, ensuring accurate and consistent messaging to the public about Product vision and releases.

Actively engaged in community-driven events, incorporating user feedback into iterative product improvements.

4. DAO Setup & Management
Assisted in setting up and managing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), promoting transparent governance and community-driven decision-making.

Created NFTs to enable gated access on platforms like Snapshot, ensuring only authorized token or NFT holders could participate in DAO votes.

Involved in conceptualizing and managing specialized DAOs—such as a gaming DAO aimed at uniting guilds and games to create a data marketplace, as well as a health DAO for incentivizing health-related data.

5. Strategic Initiatives
Contributed to bridging strategies between blockchains, including proposing fee structures and treasury contributions to facilitate cross-chain functionality.

Assisted in setting up liquidity pools, implementing token burn mechanisms, and exploring other DeFi strategies.

Collaborated on AI integration efforts, and emerging co-creation concepts for user-generated intellectual property.

6. Cross-Functional Collaboration
Worked closely with development, product, and marketing teams to keep roadmaps aligned and ensure timely product releases.

Gathered feedback during feature testing, helping to refine user flows and validate product-market fit before larger rollouts.

Bridged technical and non-technical stakeholders by translating complex blockchain concepts into clear, actionable insights for broader audiences.

7. Semi-Technical Role
As a semi-technical product manager, balanced business goals with technical feasibility—scoping feature requirements at a high level and collaborating with developers for deeper technical integrations or troubleshooting.

Summary
Throughout my nearly three years working for a web3 company, I played a central role in QA, feature ideation, community engagement, DAO setup, and strategic planning for critical blockchain initiatives. Whether it was testing new releases, shaping the direction of a product, or ensuring the community had a voice in governance, I strived to foster transparent, user-centric, and forward-thinking solutions. This blend of technical insight and product-focused mindset is something I bring to every project, along with a passion for exploring the next wave of blockchain innovation.
